# Random Forest Classification Model

This repository contains a **Random Forest Classification Model** implemented in Python using the `scikit-learn` library. The model is trained to classify data into predefined categories and is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.


## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **classification model** using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics. This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, feature selection).
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **wine dataset**, which contains 150 samples of wine data with features 'feature_names': 'alcohol',
  'malic_acid',
  'ash',
  'alcalinity_of_ash',
  'magnesium',
  'total_phenols',
  'flavanoids',
  'nonflavanoid_phenols',
  'proanthocyanins',
  'color_intensity',
  'hue',
  'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
  'proline'} and 3 target classes (class_0 ,class_1 ,class_2).
